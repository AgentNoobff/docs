**BedWars1058** is providing [Parties](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/parties-1-8-1-13.3709/) (by AlessioDP) support since version 0.8beta (API 11).

If players make a party and then join a BedWars game, BedWars1058 will put them in the same team.

Just install the Parties plugin on the BedWars server and that's it :smile:. You can additionally 
 configure the minimum party rank allowed to select an arena.
